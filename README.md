This project is the main assessment of this subject. It is worth 50% of your total assessment. You are required to create ATM system that you will implement Abstract Data Type and Graphic User Interface over the whole semester. All work is to be completed individually. If parts or all of the source code you submit is not your own work, you will receive ZERO.

Part 1. ADT Implementation
This first part is worth 20% of you total assessment. First, you need to implement Abstract Data Type.

Situation
Following discussions at the recent annual directors meeting of the AITBank financial organization, it has been decided to embrace the benefits of Information Technology in streamlining their customer services.

To this end AITBank has decided to implement a new Transaction processing system that will allow customer to withdraw money from their accounts as well as make deposits to their accounts. It is envisaged that there will be multiple customer interfaces to this system such as Web based access and automatic teller machines (ATMs).

AITBank has 4 account types, which need to be used with the system.
	•	Saving accounts
	•	Cheque accounts
	•	Net-saver accounts
	•	Fixed accounts

Saving account offer interest, which calculated daily, and Net-saver account offer higher interest than Saving, which calculated monthly. Cheque account does not offer any interest, but it does not have daily withdrawal limit same as Fixed account, which calculated base on contract period. However, customer who withdraws from Fixed account before the due date, will not get any interest. Daily withdrawal limit for saving account can be customize for each customer. In addition, ATMs machine can give only 20, 50 and 100 notes.

Task A
Design a series of abstract data types (ATDs) to model the above transaction processing system. Implement your ADT designs using Java.

Note: Remember that your classes should only model the data, transactions and business logic of the bank and NOT the interface.

Task B
Create a set of concrete classes to demonstrate the abstract data types are working properly. Note: State clearly any assumptions you make.


When is due
	Week 7, late penalty would be applied refer to AIT late submission policy.

Submission
	Compress and submit your java code project and Abstract Data Design Document in Jivi using the following STRICT filename convention and in ZIP format.

	Example: 1234_John_Doe_Assessment1.pdf


Part 2. GUI Implementation
This second part is worth 30% of you total assessment. You need to implement Graphic User Interface for ATM system.


Develop ATM system Graphic User Interface, for the AITBank System developed in Assignment 1. Your system should be designed base on real ATM machine, sample design above, however you should demonstrate your design creativity on layout and messages are displayed. Other functions are list below:
	•	Your system design, ATM interface, should allow users to make multiple transactions on the same account without having to re-enter their password number.
	•	You have to also document any assumptions that you make about the functionality of the interface.
	•	Make sure that your code is well-formatted, good notation and has comments to make it easily readable and reusable, recommend JavaDoc style comment.


When is due
	Week 12, late penalty would be applied refer to AIT late submission policy.

Submission
	Compress and submit your project in Jivi using the following STRICT filename convention and in ZIP format.
